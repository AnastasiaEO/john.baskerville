    <p> Hi!
        
        So. Hopefully in a few more years I can fill this section up better, but you always have to start somewhere. I'm Anastasia Owens, an Interaction Design (UX) student from Belfast. 
    </p>
<p> Why Interaction Design you ask?
    </p>
    
    <p> I wanted to create. After studying fine art for GCSE's and A Levels, I wanted to move to a more digital platform. Computers are tomorrow, no matter if we like it or not, and I want to be part of it. Plus, nobody can spill coffee on your canvas, only your computer...
    </p>

    <h3 id="Conclusion"> <strong>Conclusion</strong> </h3>
    <p>
Paul Rand, to this day, remains a great influencer in corporate branding and imagery. He was a great influence in the 1950’s and 1960’s, described by graphic designer Louis Danziger 
</p>
    <blockquote>
‘He almost singlehandedly convinced business that design was an effective tool. Anyone designing in the 1950s and 1960s owed much to Rand, who largely made it possible for us to work. He more than anyone else made the profession reputable. We went from being commercial artists to being graphic designers largely on his merits’
</blockquote>
    <p>
Rand was highly commemorated by a design legend such as Steve Jobs, showing that his work was on such a high standard that the owner of a billion dollar company, creator of the iphone, the iPod and Mac computer systems. For Steve Jobs to recognise the achievements and though process of a designer such as Rand, for me means that he was truly someone remarkable.
</p>
    <p>
Rand’s work is still visible today and in use by companies such as IBM, UPS and Westinghouse, showing that Rand successfully influenced and changed corporate branding, particularly in America, as his work has successfully stood the test of time almost 60 years lately. I strongly believe that Rand advanced corporate branding largely into the future, due to the fact that so many large brands can trace their imagery back to him, and that it is still recognisable to this day.
